# Todos with go
## A simple TODO tracker written in go
### Discription
<p>Like the title implies, it is a very barebones and simple todo tracker written in go. <br>The todos are stored in a csv file in `./assets`</p>

### How to run
<p>Simply clone the repo and execute `go run ./cmd/main.go` in the root directory of the project.<br>If you are stuck, just run `help` and you get a list of commands you can execute.</p>
<p>Because the screen gets cleared after every command, it currently only works with linux. You can change that with your contribution if you want</p>
